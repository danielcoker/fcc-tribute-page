        <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Boulaug's life:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><span>1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li>
            <span>1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as

          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
            in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I
            saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="quote">
          "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
          contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
          scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
